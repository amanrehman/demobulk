{ "data" : [ {"title":"so seems like this particular piece has 30% less capacity than the ...","review":"Bought this product from Cloudtail India during one of the Amazon sales.What comes in the box:10400mAh Powerbank, Charging cable, instruction manual.Charging:I have an phone with a battery capacity of approx 3000 mAh and the power bank gives me about 2-2.5 charges... so seems like this particular piece has 30% less capacity than the 10400 mAh.Size & Weight:I have to say that this product is larger than i thought it would be when i bought it. It is about 5.5 inches long - which is about the size of a pen, 2 inches tall and 1 inch high.This being said, it is pretty light and can easily be carried around in your bag but probably would not fit in your pocket.Overall, i think that for many people a battery pack with a single charge might be easier to carry around and do the trick of getting your phone through the entire day... but if you are constantly on the move or need the exrta capacity, this would be a great bet.","rating":"4.0","score":3,"comparative":0.01639344262295082,"effective":0.06557377049180328,"wordLength":5},{"title":"Good Performance","review":"It has been two months that I brought this power bank & I have to say that this powerbank is working very much good. Its very decent looking power bank. I have the black colour variant of it and its very easy to use it. The device comes with 2 USB ports for charging having an output current of 2.1 A and an output voltage of 5 V. Its very hand and easy to use. One intresting feature of the powerbank which i like is that when you plug your device its automatically starts charging the device without you needed to switch it on. It has a decent looking battery indicator . And all of the above this device comes from a well reputed company so its really value for you money. So thumbs up to this power bank and I would suggest you to buy this since its very good in performance but also at the same time its affordable too..","rating":"5.0","score":12,"comparative":0.06857142857142857,"effective":0.34285714285714286,"wordLength":6},{"title":"Not a good one","review":"I thought Lenovo is a good brand, but thinking is not always right.Reviewing it after use of 1 year.Battery is the most Important thing as it is shown it's of 10400 mah power, but its actually capacity is 5k-5.5k,Looks like a duplicate one,Maybe amazon has cheated,After using ut for a 1 year its capacity had decreased to abt. 4k mah..So buy intex or syska at the place of this lenovo...
